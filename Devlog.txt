PostPorduction:
I originally wanted to create Ball Blast Cannon. I ended up making a variant of the asteroids game. Implementing the physical game objects player, rocks, and lasers went well. Implementation of UI elements not so much. I wish I knew how much my ideas would change throughout the process. Im glad I know that now so I don't spend as much time thinking about what I want to do.
